Changes since version 0.2:

- glmVertexNormals(): have an option to add normals only where undefined
- added support for DevIL
  (suggested by Nuno Guerreiro <nuno.guerreiro@lesium.org>)


Changes since Nate Robbins' glm.c:

- warning/error functions in glm_util.c
- added glmStrStrip function to handle filenames with spaces
- handle material-by-face if there is more than one usemtl in a group
- removed "static" from glmDraw variables (so that the code is reentrant)
- write obj with material-by-face
- added blending support, from GLM_AVL http://www.avl.iu.edu/projects/GLM_AVL/
- separated texture loading (now in glmimg.c), and support many more image
  formats (PNG & JPEG natively, plus those supported by SDL_image and simage).
