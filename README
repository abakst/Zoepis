How to build and run Zoepis
===========================

Installation:
For now, the only way to build this is to make sure that libglm, libpng, and libjpeg are installed on your system.

First install libjpg and libpng. These can be found at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg/
http://www.libpng.org/

Then install libglm:

Once these libraries are installed, run `make basic_test'. This will either compile all the haskell files successfully, or not ;). This will produce an executable, basic_test, which is all I have to show for myself right now.

Running:
All there is to run now is a file, basic_test.

$ ./basic_test

You can include any of the modules defined in the Z*hs files and make your own project, however! That is fun.

================
When there is a finished product, I might put effort into developing a .cabal file that will do all this for you.
