Installation/Compilation
========================
For now, the only way to build this is to make sure that libglm, libpng, and libjpeg are installed on your system.

Then, run `make basic_test,' and you should either be all set.

When there is a finished product, I might put effort into developing a .cabal file that will do all this for you.
