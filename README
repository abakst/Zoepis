How to build and run Zoepis
===========================

Installation:
For now, the only way to build this is to make sure that
libglm, libpng, and libjpeg are installed on your system.

First install libjpg and libpng. These can be found at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg/
http://www.libpng.org/

Then install libglm:

There are two test programs that are included: basic_test.hs, which
includes some objects and keyboard/mouse camera control, and
conway.hs, which is a basic implementation of Conway's game of life. To build either of these, run

$ make <target>

where <target> is either conway or basic_test. There is also a
run_<target> Makefile target that can be used to build and then run an
executable:

$ make run_basic_test

will build and then execute basic_test.

You can include any of the modules defined in the Z*hs files and make your own project, however! That is fun.

================
When there is a finished product, I might put effort into developing a .cabal file that will do all this for you.
